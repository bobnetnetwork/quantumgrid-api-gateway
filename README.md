# API Gateway

The **API Gateway** serves as the central entry point for all client requests to the QuantumGrid platform, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

## Features

- Centralized request routing
- Load balancing
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Authentication and authorization handling
- Logging and monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: Programming language
- **Spring Boot**: Microservice framework
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: API Gateway implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 17** or higher
- **Maven** for build automation

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bobnetnetwork/quantumgrid-api-gateway.git
    cd quantumgrid-api-gateway
    ```

2. Configure the routing and microservice endpoints in `src/main/resources/application.yml`:
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
            - id: user-service
              uri: http://localhost:8081
              predicates:
                - Path=/api/users/**
            - id: post-service
              uri: http://localhost:8082
              predicates:
                - Path=/api/posts/**
            # Add more routes as needed
    ```

3. Build the application:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Customization

- Add or modify routes in `application.yml` to accommodate new microservices.
- Implement custom filters for additional features like security, rate limiting, etc.
